     <h2>I am <span> A V T O </span> <br>
         Frontend Developer</h2>

         <p>
           Hello! My name is Avto, and I’m a passionate Frontend Developer who loves turning ideas into beautiful,<br> functional, and responsive websites. My journey into web development began with a simple curiosity<br> about how websites work — and quickly grew into a deep passion for creating clean, interactive user experiences. <br>

I specialize in building responsive layouts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m continuously improving<br> my skills in React to create more dynamic and scalable web applications. I also work with GitHub for version control <br> and enjoy writing well-structured, maintainable code that follows best practices.

What drives me most is the constant <br>learning and creativity that web development offers. I enjoy solving design challenges, optimizing websites for performance, <br> and experimenting with new technologies to stay up to date with modern trends.

Outside of coding, I like exploring UI/UX <br> design principles, watching tech tutorials, and building small personal projects to sharpen my skills. My long-term goal <br> is to become a Full-Stack Developer and eventually work as a Software Engineer at Microsoft, contributing to impactful <br> and innovative products.

Every line of code I write brings me closer to that goal — and I’m excited to keep growing, learning, <br> and building along the way.
